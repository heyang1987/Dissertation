\chapter{Expected Contribution}\label{chapter:conclusion}
The already implemented contribution of my thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developed a data-driven approach to designing IoT privacy-setting interfaces for three different IoT environments, namely general IoT, household IoT, and fitness IoT.
	\item Investigated the effect of IoT scenario parameters on IoT users' decisions and attitudes.
	\item Explored the trade-off between accuracy and parsimony when creating ``smart defaults/profile" for IoT users.
	\item Created a series of strategies to recommend ``smart profiles" for fitness IoT users.
\end{itemize}

If my proposed study plan can be executed and my hypothesis about the expected results hold. I would suggest the designers of future IoT privacy-setting interface to make use of our data-driven approach and carefully consider the trade-off between ``smart defaults" and ``smart profiles". Again, if my hypothesis hold and the results show that ``smart profiles" will not decrease the ease of use significantly, then ``smart profiles" is the best route for designing future IoT privacy-setting interface.
